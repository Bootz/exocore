Welcome to ExoCore
==================

ExoCore is an operating system kernel written in the C programming language
(C99 with GNU extensions, specifically meant to be built with Clang). It is
a so-called exokernel; it only provides the bare minimum of abstraction needed
around the hardware. This allows for most aspects of real operating systems to
be implemented in user space.
