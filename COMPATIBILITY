            == ExoCore Operating System Kernel ==

                -- Compatibility --

ExoCore generally requires version 2.0 of the D language.

The only supported compiler is LDC (LLVM D Compiler).

ExoCore is currently tied to x86 (64-bit) with no plans to port to other
architectures. This may change in the future if the project takes off.

ExoCore can be compiled on any POSIX system, provided that the system has
LDC installed with an x86 (64-bit) target.
