            == ExoCore Operating System Kernel ==

                -- Compatibility --

The only supported compiler is Clang (version 3.1 and up).

ExoCore is currently tied to x86 with no plans to port to other
architectures. This may change in the future if the project takes off.

ExoCore can be compiled on any POSIX system, provided that the system has
Clang installed with an x86 target.
