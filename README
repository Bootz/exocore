            == ExoCore Operating System Kernel ==

                -- Introduction --

ExoCore is an operating system kernel written in the C programming language
(C99 with GNU extensions, specifically meant to be built with Clang). It is
a so-called exokernel; it only provides the bare minimum of abstraction needed
around the hardware. This allows for most aspects of real operating systems to
be implemented in user space.

ExoCore is based on code from the XOmB project.
